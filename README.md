# AI_car_detector

This car detector uses opencv library of python for detecting cars. it works on haar file (cars.xml) which is a pre-trained car classifier file consisting data about large 
number of cars. 
this algorithm first convert the image/video file into a black and white frame for visual computing and detection and then returns to us coloured version of the file with red rectangles
around the cars detected. 
you can use tracker_img.py file for images and tracker.py for videos

This model has a working accuracy of 60-70%
